# android-spinner

Bare minimum custom spinner implementation with multiple text views.

Spinner item is a NameValue object which resides in com.example.asanga.spinner.models package. To make the cusotom view interesting, name and the value will be displayed in two separate text views. The reason for this is inorder to show two text views, you should completly customize the adapter. Default adapter supports only single text view.
